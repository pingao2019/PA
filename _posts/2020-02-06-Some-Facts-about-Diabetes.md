_The diabetes patients has risen 4 times in 34 years (1980 to 2014). It can cause blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.

Almost half of all deaths before the age of 70 years are attributable to diabetes.It is the seventh leading cause of death in 2016._

## Some facts :

It is strongly associated to age, obesity, pregnancy, blood pressure, genetic factor . Diabetes can be treated with diet, physical activity, medication .

## How I did?

I collected, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the data (size 768 x 9).

# Methods & Analysis:

## I. To build a correlation coefficients matrix

We can see glucose level shows positive correlation with insulin (r= 33.13%), age (r= 26.35%), BMI (r= 22.11%), blood pressure (r= 15.26%), genetic factor (13.73%), pregnancy (r= 12.95%), Skin Thickness(r= 5.73%).

Blue : positive correlation; Peach: negative correlation
Outcome=1: diabetes; outcome=0 : normal

# Conclusion:

Diabetes is strongly associated to age, obesity, pregnancy, blood pressure, genetic factor . They show positive correlated.

Diabetes can be treated with diet, physical activity, medication.
